			<h2> Hey. A pop-up Burning Man. </h2>
		</header>
		<h5>There is a small festival this Sunday--</h5>
		<p>a festival of self-expression, of gift-giving, of play. An unstructured place to simply be whoever you are, to experiment with new social norms, to be alone, and/or to sit still with your wise inner cactus. This festival is made entirely out of people. This festival is made entirely out of you. No one else is in charge.</p>

		<p>It's possible that this festival is a letting-go, a slight relaxing of the shoulders, a small side-step to take a deep breath of fresh reality. Maybe that means something to you and maybe it means nothing, but either way, you are invited to be a co-creator of this festival.</p>

		<p>Gather at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Golden+Gate+Bridge,+San+Francisco,+CA&daddr=Rodeo+Beach&hl=en&ll=37.827752,-122.518244&spn=0.040541,0.086689&sll=37.803884,-122.465029&sspn=0.04998,0.11055&geocode=Fe3pQAIdaiaz-CEJVXCDlxPtzSnD____3oaFgDEJVXCDlxPtzQ%3BFSI-QQIdVj2y-Ck7XNpc9YWFgDGqWMqiWqqaxw&oq=Rodeo+&t=h&mra=ls&z=14">Rodeo Beach</a> at <strong>noon on Sunday, September 1.</strong> Only after all the self-selected co-creators have made their mark on the playa will the festival will magically disappear again, sometime after sundown.<p>

		<p>At <strong>sunset</strong>, we will, all together, surrender something into the ocean of air or water: a thought, a prayer, a wish, a fear, a burp, a scientific theorem -- whatever it is, we will release them.</p>

		<h2>Here are 7 values to consider adopting as your own for the festival.</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Self-reliance. Bring your own food, water, clothing, costumes, and anything else you might want to use to nourish and enjoy yourself. (Barter if you like.) As rugged individuals, we can make our home anywhere.</li>

			<li>Gift-giving. Every person is highly encouraged bring any object, musical instrument, art project, idea, service, food, mind-altering stimulant, or collective experience to the playa for the enjoyment and benefit of others, aiding the creation of a new and ephemeral shared culture in which all aforementioned rugged individuals contribute to the well-being of the whole. This festival cannot exist without the gifts of your time and courage.

			<li>Celebration. Not only do we mark the first of September and the beginning of the end of summer, but we seize the opportunity to have a really really really good time. Go crazy. Do whatever you've felt like doing.</li>

			<li>Appreciation. On this Sunday we stand back from the average day and the average us (or, if you prefer, we dive more fully and deeply inside the average day and the average us) and notice how great it all is.</li>

			<li>Simplicity. This is a pop-up Burning Man. It's in 5 days from now. There isn't time to build a 3-story-playground art car (unless it's already in your 3-story garage, in which case bring it! ). How simple an art project can you conceive, how simple a shared experience? What are the tiny precious gifts you can bring for other people? </li>

			<li>Impulsiveness. This is a pop-up Burning Man. Do whatever. Life is chaotic.</li>

			<li>Inclusiveness. When you do whatever, invite others to join you.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>Regardless of whether or not you accept or adopt these values, we hope you will show up ready for whatever happens, with an open mind and heart. Y'know?</p>

		<p>Lastly: invite others.</p>

		<h2> FAQ </h2>
		<h5> What should I bring? </h5>
		<p> Bring your own food, costumes, layers, and any gifts you'd like to bequeath unto the small community (whether it's grapes, an art project to participate in, a guitar to make music with, or a random idea we can make happen).</p>
		<h5> How can I get there? </h5>
		<p> From the East Bay: drive over the Richmond Bridge to the Marin Headlands, then follow the road down to the beach. There will be parking. Or, take BART to SF and bike over the bridge!</p>
		<p> From San Francisco: bike or drive over the Golden Gate Bridge, take the first exit on your right off the highway, go through the tunnel on your left and head to the coast.</p>
